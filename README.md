# zeekay/zsh
My zsh dotfiles, compatible with [ellipsis][ellipsis].

## Features
Uses my [zsh][zsh] framework, [zeesh!][zeesh] All sorts of advanced mumbo
jumbo. You'll probably want to disable the vim keybindings by removing
vi-mode from the list of `zeesh_plugins` in `~/.zshrc`.

## Install
Clone and symlink or install with [ellipsis][ellipsis]:

## Customization
#### `~/.zsh/local/after.zsh`
Will be sourced after default zshrc.

```
$ ellipsis install zeekay/zsh
```
